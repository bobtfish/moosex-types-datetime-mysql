NAME
    MooseX::Types::DateTime::MySQL - Joins MooseX::Types::DateTime and
    DateTime::Format::MySQL

DESCRIPTION
    Defines a "MySQLDateTime" type which will round-trip coerce to the
    "DateTime" type from MooseX::Types::DateTime.

TYPES
  MySQLDateTime
    Coerces to and from "DateTime".

  MySQLDate
    Coerces to and from "DateTime" and will coerce to "MySQLDateTime".

  MySQLTime
    Coerces from "Int" (duration) and "DateTime" (by extracting only the
    time part).

BUGS
    The MySQL datetime detection regex is imperfect as it just looks for "
    \d "s, rather than things which are known valid months.
    Probably more
