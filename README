NAME
    MooseX::Types::DateTime::MySQL - Joins MooseX::Types::DateTime and
    DateTime::Format::MySQL

DESCRIPTION
    Defines a "MySQLDateTime" type which will round-trip coerce to the
    "DateTime" type from MooseX::Types::DateTime.

TYPES
  MySQLDateTime
    Coerces to and from "DateTime".

BUGS
    The MySQL datetime detection regex is imperfect as it just looks for "
    \d "s, rather than things which are known valid months.
    Probably more
